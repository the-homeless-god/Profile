The tools that I use to help me grow professionally? Roadmaps and boards like Trello, Roadmunk, and Notion. A calendar with reminders so you can track items you’ve completed. Also, I would recommend reading books about time management and self-organization.

To speed up your promotion, improve your soft skills. You can’t grow successfully with communication gaps and confusion. Self-discipline will be your best friend on each step. Don’t overwhelm your manager with notifications. Talk with colleagues and ask your team about the next stage of the ladder. Your growth is your responsibility.

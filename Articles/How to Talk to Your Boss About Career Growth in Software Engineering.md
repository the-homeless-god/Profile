### Quote

If you want to grow, there are two scenarios: you either know where you want to grow or you don’t. You’re not going to get immediate results but the point is to agree on action items with your manager and create a roadmap illustrating your desired growth trajectory. This approach will help you make things more transparent and gamify the process.

### Quote

If you feel you’ve outgrown your role, it’s time to turn to your manager saying “Hey, could you please share what you think of my performance at the moment? Could you please suggest how I could make my delivery more transparent when working on my growth action items?"

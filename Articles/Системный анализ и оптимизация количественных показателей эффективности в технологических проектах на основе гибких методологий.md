## Abstract
In this article, the authors conducted a comprehensive research of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) system within the framework of agile project management methodologies, such as Agile Scrum, Agile Kanban, and Rapid Application Development (RAD). The primary objective of the study was to identify, analyze, and subsequently rank KPIs for their optimal application in various project contexts. Management specifics at different project stages were examined, starting from startups and ending with products in the support stage. The article also delves into the technical aspects of each methodology, highlighting key KPIs related to development processes and project goal achievement. The research results underscore the unique features of each methodology while also revealing common trends and overlapping KPIs. In conclusion, the authors present a comparative analysis of different agile methodologies, emphasizing their advantages, limitations, and application prospects. This article is intended for professionals in the field of technological project management who aspire to optimize their processes based on quantitative indicators.
